# WWWAnalysisRun2

## ```analysis/``` contains the main analysis looper

## ```fakerate/``` is for deriving the fake rate

## ```leptonsf/``` is for deriving the lepton scale factors using tag-and-probe

## ```wwwbabymaker/``` is for creating WWW babies

## For future reference

1. create babies from wwwbabymaker. (FR and WWW baby)
2. run fakerate on FR baby and obtain fake rate histograms
3. run analysis with the obtained fakerate histograms
4. push out results?
5. ... profit?
